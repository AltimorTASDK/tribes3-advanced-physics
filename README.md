This repo will be amended to document the full details of every advanced physics mechanic in T3 in both theory and practical use.

Precise information was obtained by enabling `ShowQADebug=True` in `%LOCALAPPDATA%/Topaz/Saved/Config/Windows/GameUserSettings.ini` for position and velocity display, capping my framerate to 60 to ensure consistent deltatime and that I record every frame, and analyzing crafted scenarios frame by frame to deduce the logic. `ShowQADebug` uses the engine units of cm and cm/s, and the Z axis is up.
